Scrum clanek


Enviroment I am talking about
- Product team with continous development of a product and its operation.
- Fullstack team of a 5-7 people.
- Team uses work-log software (Jira, Trello, etc)
- Members can work remotely, even from different timezones
- work is delivered as it is developed - not waiting for some release window

What is software in crisis?
- Developers repeatedly are not able to deliver features/fixes and keep business running
- Delivered features does not meet expected quality
- Delivering features consumes too much resources 
- Developers are not happy and are considering a job change


Scrum is a crisis management tool
Scrum is a good tool to find the reasons of a software crises.
Lets take a closer look what purpose each of scrum practices and why they serves as a crisis management tool 
* Planning
> team starts out a sprint with a discussion to determine which items from the product backlog they will work on during the sprint
* Daily Scrum aka Standup
> Discussion where the team coordinates their activities for the following day. The Daily Scrum is not intended to be a status reporting meeting or a problem solving discussion.

This is my "favorite" part of scrum. 
Why to coordinate if all the information about who is working on what is in ticketing system? 
Why to wait with work coordination to next day if I need to coordinate now?
If I already coordinated my work with a colleague why should I do it formally on a standup meeting?
Why a javascript guy needs to know that I will be upgrading spring boot today because I need better support for messaging? 
If I work in remote-ready environment why should I be awake if I am in some exoting timezone?

And then there is the real life standup:
- conversation always slips to problem solving
- most people are there just to say their part and not listening at all
- there is always this talkative guy who keeps on talking and prolongs the meeting to half an hour
- if the meeting is in the morning there is always someone who is late

All those problems can magicaly disapear if you skip standups. 

There are only two things in which daily standups are good at. 
You can each day observe what the team is strugling with. But most teams are no, for most of the time, in crisis and doing their usual job. The once in a time struggle is not worth meeting each day. 
Secondly it forces team members with low self-discipline to do at least some work because they must present it on the standup next day.
But as stated in agaile manifesto:
> Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. 
If you do not trust a member to do their job you should help him grow or eventualy fire him.  

Use your work-track tool and mostly talk to each other! That will help you more that daily scrum.



* Sprint Review
> At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the results of the sprint with stakeholders of the product. The purpose is to discuss, demonstrate, and potentially give the stakeholders a chance to use, the increment in order to get feedback

From Agile manifesto
> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
and 
> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project

For me this means close cooperation with product owners WHILE developing the feature. Not at the end, now. Not making any assumptions and waiting for the end of a sprint. 
Did the product owner changed the feature description after half of it was developed? Without scrum its not a problem, it will just take more time. With scrum you and up arguing why you did not made it in time again and again. Tasks are changing all the time. Embrace the change, dont try to lock yourself in a sprint cage. After not meeting the sprint plan for the tenth time in a row I am sure all the members must feel frustrated and they have all the right to. But compare it with a non-scrum environment where the same feature was delivered within the same time. In the scrum-environemnt it will be a fail story about not fulfilling any sprint goal. In non-scum it will be a job well done in an agile way. 

* Sprint Retrospective
> At the end of the Sprint team should reflect upon how things went during the previous sprint and identify adjustments they could make going forward

This is something you should do after you finish any work. And you should do it even if you work alone. But...
I dont want to wait with discussing things bad or good after a sprint. If it makes my work harder or even impossible to do I solve it, or at least communicate it immidietaly, not after a sprint. 

Real life retrospectives also suffer from a bandwagon effect. Some members do not have anything to say but they feel oliged to say at least something positive so they repeat what was already said, making it sound more relevant than it actually is. They are sometimes even forced to come up with at least one thing from each category (positive, negative, what to do better). It is completely ok to do your job without feeling super excited about it or not to see any possible improvements. 

But again, in crisis it is usefull to see what the members saw as obstacles for delivering high-quality work on time. This is merely psychological observation of the members getting angry on each other, on business owners, blaming tools and so on.

In a good working team we cummicate problems as soon as possible and fix them if possible or at least plan the fix. 

Agile manifesto states 
> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 

And I think that the best interval is each day, hour, minute, second.

* Sprint




Problems with scrum

The problem with scrum is that when used in product development it usually causes more troubles than it actually solves. 
One of the most discussed thing in scrum is that tasks are not delivered in a sprint. Also QA have nothing to do first half of the sprint and then cannot test everything on time in the second half. 

Those are not real problems, those are problems created by scrum and you waste your time on trying to solve them instead of abandoning this poisonous cargo cult.

Tasks longer then sprint

No estimates
I am not saying estimation is completely uselles, but it is close to that. High level estimation is a must. That means "can we do it in a week, two, or a month?". No story point bullshit on a ticket level. That is a tool for crisis management, when we need to do 

When scrum does make sense:
- discoering why your dev is in crisis
- very strict need for reporting (tight budget and experimenting)
- team with low self-discipline


Conclusion:
Scrum is a good technique for the problems it was designed for. But most of the projects you will work at are not one of them. 
What do I use instead of Scrum then? I don't know. Maybe the best practice is to hire motivated people you can trust to get the job done, one who can see the business not only the code. 
Use the tools which suits your problem do not hop on on the cargo cult train of scrum.

A love agile development and that is why I cannot respect scrum. It, in many ways, goes against agile principles.
