As I mentioned in [previous week notes]({% post_url 2017-02-17-week-notes-1 %}) I will sometimes publish older notes. I started to get through my old notes a filter some interesting links. Here they are.

### Composed regex

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. ~  [Jamie Zawinski](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247)

[Composed regex](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ComposedRegex.html) is idea of breaking the complex regular expressions into smaller ones with name or comment and composing them back together. IT significantly improves readability of regexes.

### Step builder pattern
[Step builders](https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/05/building-smart-builders.html) is nice approach for building complex objects. Compared to standard builders these builders provide more fluent api and it ensures that the builder is properly setup with type checks not runtime exceptions (except nulls of course). On the other hand you have to write a lot more code. 

### Cognitive biases
There are so many biases that are affecting the way how we think. Look at that [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)! At [craft conf](https://craft-conf.com/) there was a [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jklein/cognitive-biases-in-engineering-organizations-craft-conf) about how those biases affect our work decisions. Think about decisions you have made or opinions you stand for and compare them with those biases. I have how easily I can get biased sometimes. It is always worth to remind how easily our minds can be tricked.
