Week notes numero cuatro.

#### Default hashcode implementation
Perfect in-depth investigation [how default implementation](https://srvaroa.github.io/jvm/java/openjdk/biased-locking/2017/01/30/hashCode.html ) of `hashCode` works in Java. I must admit that I had no clue about biased locking. You never stop learning something new about JVM. 

#### Self encapsulation
[Self encapsulation](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfEncapsulation.html) is an approach to accessing fields of objects via its own public api. I was thinking about it several times in the past and I preferred more the *direct access*. But this week I encountered this situation. Imagine a `SomeClass` with `items` list and a getter. There also was `SomeClassChild extends SomeClass` which overrided the getter method for some reason. 
There was also this method in `SomeClass`

```
public List<Item> getActiveItems() {
  if (items.isEmpty()) return Collections.empty();
  return items.stream().filter(Item::isActive).collect(Collectors::toList);	
}
```

This method was not returning expected values for instances of `SomeClassChild` obviously. Personally I think that the main issue is that those classes were poorly designed. BUT we make mistakes and applying self-encapsulation can safe some trouble in those situations. 

#### Test first and test after are not equivalent
Do you write tests before or after implementation? Does it even matter? Yes it does. Both produces different results. In [Symmetry breaking](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/03/07/SymmetryBreaking.html) post Uncle Bob shows that those approaches are not indeed equivalent in yet another way.

#### CQRS and event sourcing
Have you ever heard of CQRS and Event sourcing? It is a shame how few applications are built using those techniques. I like any enlightening post about this topic. This is one of them: [Why I still love CQRS](http://blog.jonathanoliver.com/why-i-still-love-cqrs-and-messaging-and-event-sourcing/).

#### Other
[Very good intro to functional programming concepts](http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html)<br/>
[Programming sucks](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks) about how software development is actually done. TLDR: it is crazy :)
