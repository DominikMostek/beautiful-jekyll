title: Your mock is a joke

When writing tests I am trying to avoid mock frameworks at any cost. Here is why

### It is not compile safe

This code is perfectly compilable, but it will fail at runtime.
```java
@Test
public void bar() {
    ITest mock = mock(ITest.class);
    doReturn(new BigDecimal(5)).when(mock).foo(1);

    mock.foo(1L);
}


interface ITest {
    String foo(Number x);
}
```

We should take advantage of compiler whenever possible. Not bypass it. This would not happen with anonymous class or a lambda.

**Make wrong use hard or even impossible**

### Using mock framework hide code smells

I think you should feel the pain of every bad design decision you have made.
Consider an interface with a lot of methods violating SRP. 

If you use mock frameowrk it ill hide the pain and you wont feel it and have the urge to fix it.

```java
HugeIface mock = mock(HugeIface.class);
doReturn(5).when(mock).fooBar();
```

This is very easy and comfortable, right? The bad design is still there but it is not that obvious. If you use anonymous class, for example the poor design choice will come to a sunlight.
You have a lot of code you dont need and most methods contains no code or just `return null`. Thus possible violation of [SRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) or/and [ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle). This is btw the same reason why I do not like project Lombok. It hides the wrong things.

**Make the bad decision visible.**

### Your code should be !easily! testable without any framework

If you need a framework to test your use cases there is somethig wrong. Some technical details are obviously leaking into your use cases.
That is the case with `@InjectMocks` annotation.
