title: Does language matter?

Programmers, including me, love programming language flame wars. This post is language agnostic polemic about motivations for switching your programming language.


### Motivation
The main problem with switching from langauge A to B is with different motivations. If your current language is preventing you in writing clean code, creating great design and improving maintainability then changing the language sounds like a good deal. 
But that is not the case, right? Is the language preventing me or is it me?

Switching the language will not solve the problem of badly written code. Your new language will only probably allow you to write bad code in simpler manner. It will be great at first. That productivity boost. But wait several rounds of newcomers and change requests. Is it still so good or are we back to unmaintainable and untestable codebase with different syntax? 

I am always skeptical when language switch becomes a topic in a team discussion. Once we improve our code to almost perfect in our current language then it is time to change the language. If programmer can't write good code in Java he will not write better code in Kotlin or Clojure. 

### Learn new languages! 
It might seem that I am one of those old grumpy programmers who think that Java is the only language that you need. Not at all. I love learning new languages. I just haven't met any codebase that would benefit from new language more than it would from programmers learning to write better code in the current one.

In novel 1984 by Goerge Orwell, [language is a tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) to shape the minds of masses. Language is something that gives you, or takes away in this case, the freedom not only to express yourself, but to think free! 
In Culture and empire by Pieter Hintjens defines the freedom as "the capacity to do interesting and useful things with other people". Combined it means that knowing more languages we have more capacity to do more useful things with others. Its freedom to collaborate with others and also freedom in thinking about the problem.

Knowing only one or very few languages, especially from single language family, makes you look at the problem from the perspective of the language not from the problem-solving point of view.

Learning new language may also teach you better ways to write the code in the old one. So definitely learn new language!

It is usually not the language itself what sucks. Its rather its mainstream usage. Java itself does not promote codebase full of [50 method interfaces]({% post_url 2017-12-05-on-interface %}). But still thats what you will find in most of them. That is the reason why good programmers leave Java world. Its mainstream usage sucks big time. I still believe we can change that and write better code in Java instead of moving to different language.
